1. I learned C++ and Visual Basic in high school, but now I am much more comfortable with Python.
I spent about two years using MATLAB, which is quite similar to Python.

2. I took the USPAS Accelerator Physics course in 2012 and I have been working with accelerators in my research since then.

3. Looking forward hearing what topics people want to hear more about. The control theory, microcontrollers, and pandas segments are new this year.
